#### Open Access and Data

def open access publications - big topic, own debates
we try to keep open (access) data distinct from this
funding agency requirements (e.g. Forskningsr√•det)
focus: what do you need to do to make data available, how to accomplish this

#### Rationale

why share data at all
data life cycle, discoverability, reuse, long tail

#### Requirements for PIs

data plan
data policies

#### Making data (usefully) available

licenses - specify conditions of use
data must be understandable
metadata
should be possible to find it even when phsyical or network location changes
PID (function, examples)
publish data in repositories / store in archives
examples: NSD, Norstore, EUDAT b2share 
pros and cons

#### Emerging trends

data publications - ubiquity press examples
a new type of role for research
RDA - an organisation to watch
