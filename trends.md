#### Open Access and Data

_The term open access is most often applied to publications - this is a big topic with its own debates and issues, which we will try to avoid here; our focus is on data._ 

To be precise we will talk about `open access to research data`. Many people prefer to use the term `open data` since it might help disentangle it from the issues that researchers are dealing with regarding open access publications.

Be that as it may, our concern here is to talk about why open data matters and how to act on it.

#### Rationale

Why share data? Why make it available to other researchers? There is no single answer and it depends on who is asking but a helpful start is to look at the Research Council of Norway's strategic position on this:

`The Research Councilâ€™s Policy on Open Access to Research Data aims to ensure that such data are accessible to relevant users, on equal terms, and at the lowest possible cost. Better access to research data enhances the quality of research in that results can more readily be validated and verified and datasets can be used in new ways and in combination with other datasets. Open access to research data also helps to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and may pave the way for more interdisciplinary research.`

funding agency requirements (e.g. RCN)
data life cycle, discoverability, reuse, long tail
focus: what do you need to do to make data available, how to accomplish this

#### Requirements for PIs

data plan
data policies

#### Making data (usefully) available

licenses - specify conditions of use
data must be understandable
metadata
should be possible to find it even when phsyical or network location changes
PID (function, examples)
publish data in repositories / store in archives
examples: NSD, Norstore, EUDAT b2share 
pros and cons

#### Emerging trends

data publications - ubiquity press examples
a new type of role for research
RDA - an organisation to watch
