### Open Access and Data

_The term open access is most often applied to publications - this is a big topic with its own debates and issues, which we will try to avoid here; our focus is on data._ 

To be precise we will talk about `open access to research data`. Many people prefer to use the term `open data` since it might help disentangle it from the issues that researchers are dealing with regarding open access publications.

Be that as it may, our concern here is to talk about why open data matters and how to act on it.

#### Rationale

Why share data? Why make it available to other researchers? 

There is no single answer and it depends on who is asking but a helpful start is to look at the Research Council of Norway's strategic position on this:

`The Research Councilâ€™s Policy on Open Access to Research Data aims to ensure that such data are accessible to relevant users, on equal terms, and at the lowest possible cost. Better access to research data enhances the quality of research in that results can more readily be validated and verified and datasets can be used in new ways and in combination with other datasets. Open access to research data also helps to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts and may pave the way for more interdisciplinary research.` [source](http://www.forskningsradet.no/en/Article/Open_access_to_research_data/1240958527698?lang=en)

A rather banal rationale to share research data is therefore that it is part of funding agency requirements - that is, if your project is wholly or partly funded by the RCN then you should care about this. But it is also about building better science. We can talk about this in terms of a [data life cycle](http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/create-manage/life-cycle) (a very popular conceptual tool in research data discussions). 

As emphasised by the data life cycle concept, open data is supposed to enhance data discoverability and ultimately lead to productive reuse. This would lower the costs of producing novel research which is one reason people often refer to the [long tail](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_tail) when they talk about open data.

OK great, so how do we accomplish this?

#### Data Management Plans

Principle Investigators (PIs) need to create and maintain [Data Management Plans](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/resources/data-management-plans). Plans typically state what data will be created and how, and outline the plans for sharing and preservation, noting what is appropriate given the nature of the data and any restrictions that may need to be applied.

A plan like this is embodied in a living document - a description that changes over time. To ease the creation and management of such plans various institutions, life the [Digital Curation Centre](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/), host [online tools](https://dmponline.dcc.ac.uk/) for DMPs.

There is an effort within the nationally funded [Norstore project](https://www.sigma2.no/content/norstore-services) to create a DMP tool with integreation to other publication and research tools at UiO. The vision is to be able to create DMPs by answering yes/no style questions to enhance the precision and usefulness of the plans themselves.

#### Making data (usefully) available

To structure the discussion we can refer to the RCNs guidelines (based on EU H2020 [guidelines](http://ec.europa.eu/research/participants/data/ref/h2020/grants_manual/hi/oa_pilot/h2020-hi-oa-pilot-guide_en.pdf)). Research data should be...

1. stored/archived in a safe and secure manner
2. accessible for reuse
3. made accessible at an early stage
4. accompanied by standardised metadata
5. provided with a license for access, reuse and redistribution
6. made accessible at the lowest possible cost
7. be provided with a long-term plan

We have touched upon reuse (in the rationale) and the long-term plan (DPM) and we can leave the cost aspect for another discussion. That leaves us with: `storage/archiving`, `metadata` and `licensing`.

##### Storage

Two Norwegian data archives (or repositories) are available: the [Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)](http://www.nsd.uib.no/nsddata/arkivering/en/001_deposit_data.html) archive, and the [Norstore data archive](https://www.norstore.no/services/archive) - which is still in a beta phase.

pros and cons
should be possible to find it even when phsyical or network location changes

##### Metadata

data must be understandable
metadata

##### Licenses

licenses - specify conditions of use

#### Emerging trends

data publications - ubiquity press examples
a new type of role for research
RDA - an organisation to watch
